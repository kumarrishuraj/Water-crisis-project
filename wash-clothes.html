        <p>Consider wearing clothes more than once before washing, when appropriate. By running fewer loads, you save both water and energy, as each load uses around 20-40 gallons of water.</p>

        <h2>Water-Saving Tips for Laundry</h2>

        <h3>1. Use the Right Load Size</h3>
        <p>Adjust the water level on your washing machine according to the load size, or only wash full loads. This reduces water use significantly.</p>

        <h3>2. Opt for Quick Wash Settings</h3>
        <p>Many machines have a "quick wash" cycle, which uses less water and energy. This setting is perfect for lightly soiled clothes.</p>

        <h3>3. Choose Cold Water Washing</h3>
        <p>Cold water requires less energy and can also save water. Cold cycles are effective for most clothes, helping you reduce energy and water bills.</p>

        <h3>4. Hand Wash Small Items</h3>
        <p>Consider hand washing small loads or delicate items. This saves water by only using what's necessary to wash and rinse.</p>
