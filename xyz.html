        <h2>Why Save Water?</h2>
        <p>As a CSE student, conserving water can save you money and help the environment. Whether you're in a dorm or shared apartment, these tips are easy to implement and can make a big difference.Saving water is crucial for sustaining life and the environment. Freshwater resources, which make up only about 2.5% of the Earth's total water, are finite and unequally distributed. With increasing populations, urbanization, and industrialization, the demand for water has skyrocketed, leading to over-extraction from rivers, lakes, and aquifers. If we don't conserve water, many regions may face acute water shortages, leading to conflicts over this essential resource.<br><br>

            Water is vital for agriculture, which in turn is necessary for food production. Around 70% of freshwater is used in irrigation. Inefficient use of water in farming can lead to soil degradation, reduced crop yields, and food insecurity. Additionally, industries depend on water for manufacturing processes, and energy production, like hydroelectric and thermal power plants, requires significant amounts of water.<br><br>
            
            The environment is also impacted by water wastage. Rivers, wetlands, and forests need water to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems. Excessive water extraction disrupts these habitats, affecting plants and animals, and reducing natural resilience to climate change. Moreover, saving water also means reducing the energy used in water purification, pumping, and transportation, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>
            
            By conserving water, we ensure that future generations will have access to this critical resource. Simple actions like fixing leaks, using efficient appliances, and mindful consumption can help preserve water and secure a sustainable future for all.</p>

        <h2>Water Saving Tips</h2>
        <div class="tips">
            <a href="shorter-shower.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="shorter shower.png" alt="Shorter Showers">
                <h3>Take Shorter Showers</h3>
                <p>Reduce shower time to 5 minutes or less. This not only saves water but also gives you more time to study or relax!</p>
            </a>

            <a href="wash-clothes.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="washing cloths.png" alt="Wash Clothes">
                <h3>Wash Clothes Less Often</h3>
                <p>Wear clothes more than once (if appropriate) before washing. Running fewer loads of laundry saves both water and energy.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="report-leaks.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="plumber-fixing.png" alt="Fix Leaks">
                <h3>Report Leaks to Maintenance</h3>
                <p>If you notice a leaky faucet or running toilet in your dorm or apartment, report it to the maintenance team. Fixing leaks saves hundreds of gallons of water.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="run-full-loads.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="dishwasher.png" alt="Dishwasher">
                <h3>Run Full Loads</h3>
                <p>Whether it's the dishwasher or washing machine, only run full loads to maximize water use efficiency.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="turn-off-tap.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="tap_off.png" alt="Turn off Tap">
                <h3>Turn Off the Tap While Brushing</h3>
                <p>Turning off the tap while brushing your teeth or washing your face saves about 3-4 gallons of water each time.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="reusable-bottle.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="water_bottle.png" alt="Reusable Bottle">
                <h3>Use a Reusable Water Bottle</h3>
                <p>Instead of running the tap each time you're thirsty, keep a reusable bottle handy and refill it as needed.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="water-plants.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="water_plant.png" alt="Water Plants">
                <h3>Water Plants Wisely</h3>
                <p>If you have plants, water them in the early morning or late evening to reduce evaporation and save water.</p>
            </a>

            <a href="wash-vehicle.html" class="tip-card">
                <img src="car_wash.png" alt="Wash Vehicle">
                <h3>Wash Your Vehicle Carefully</h3>
                <p>Use a bucket and sponge to wash your vehicle instead of a hose. This reduces water waste significantly.</p>
