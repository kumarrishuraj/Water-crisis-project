        <h1>Run Full Loads</h1>
        <img src="dishwasher.png" alt="Run Full Loads">
        <p>Running full loads in your dishwasher or washing machine helps maximize water efficiency. Partial loads can waste both water and energy, making full loads a key habit for eco-friendly laundry and dishwashing.</p>

        <h2>Why Running Full Loads Saves Water</h2>
        <p>Most modern appliances use a set amount of water per cycle, whether the machine is full or half-empty. Running full loads ensures each gallon is used effectively, reducing the number of cycles and saving up to 3,400 gallons of water per year in an average household.</p>

        <h2>Additional Tips for Efficient Use</h2>

        <h3>1. Choose the Right Settings</h3>
        <p>Many dishwashers and washing machines come with eco-friendly or water-saving settings. For lightly soiled dishes and clothes, these settings reduce water and energy consumption by adjusting the cycle length and water usage.</p>

        <h3>2. Avoid Pre-Rinsing Dishes</h3>
        <p>Modern dishwashers are designed to handle food residue effectively. Skipping the pre-rinse can save up to 20 gallons of water per load. Just scrape off large particles and let the machine do the rest.</p>

        <h3>3. Sort Laundry by Soil Level</h3>
        <p>Washing heavily soiled clothes together reduces the need for extra wash cycles. By sorting items by soil level, you can avoid over-washing lightly soiled clothes, saving water and energy.</p>

        <h3>4. Use High-Efficiency Detergents</h3>
        <p>High-efficiency (HE) detergents are designed for low-water washing machines and prevent excess suds, which require additional rinsing. This minimizes water usage per load, optimizing the effectiveness of each cycle.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Running full loads and using efficient settings helps reduce your householdâ€™s water footprint, conserves energy, and extends the life of your appliances. Water-saving habits contribute to less strain on local water resources, which is crucial in areas facing droughts or water scarcity.</p>
